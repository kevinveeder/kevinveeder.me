          <p style="margin: 0 auto;"> In 2021, I was fortunate enough to accept an opportunity with GM in Chandler, Arizona at their IT Innovation Center. As a software developer, I partner with developers, architects, and test analysts for the efficient delivery of customer support applications. Additionally, I assist in the implementation of automated data conversion for user manuals, FAQ's, and other legacy material. This process serves to increase efficieny in the modifications/devlopement of future documents. Using custom XSLT Style sheets, we are able to transform our existing XML documents into malliable DITA XML pdfs.</p>
