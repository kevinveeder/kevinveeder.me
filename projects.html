            <ul>
              <li><em>This report was my final project for my Capstone Statistics class at MSU.</em></li>
                <br>
              <li><u>Purpose:</u> to predict a few thousand Housing prices based on each unique residence's individual characteristics. We were provided 2 sets of data to do so with, DataSet1 & DataSet2. In the first data set, we were given the characteristics of each home (e.g., Number of Baths, Basements, Bedrooms Above Ground, Garage access, Total Rooms, Total Bathrooms Above Ground, etc.), as well as the final price that each place ultimately sold for. Our task was to identify which of these characteristics from DataSet1 were more highly correlated to the final sales prices. Then - based on these main identifiers - we had to build various models to predict what each house in DataSet2 actually sold for.</li>
                <br>
              </li><u>Results:</u> with over thousands of houses in which we had to predict the prices for, <strong>my analysis showed less than a 12% error rate - meaning that ~88% of my predictions were correct.</strong></li>
